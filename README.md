- System uses a meta-symbol pattern matching engine (LLM-based)
- Archetype is selected and interpreted
- Response includes insight, options, and reflective prompts

## What It Does

Clarifies the user's current state of mind using meta-symbol analysis, then offers archetype-based guidance and aligned action options.

## What the User Gains

Effectiveness, agency, presence, self-assurance, and peace.
